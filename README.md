# Machine_Learning_Final_Project
**By: Sophie Margolis & Jeremy Sprung**
<br>This project was done as a final project in the Machine Learning course at Tel Aviv University.
We focused on analyzing PE files (.exe), which are versatile executable file formats used in different operating systems, including Windows. Our primary goal is to develop a binary classifier capable of effectively distinguishing between malicious and benign files. To achieve that we explored the 23 features within our dataset, using advanced techniques and models to examine a collection of 60,000 distinct files and identify patterns indicative of malware behavior. Our primary goal was to develop
a binary classifier capable of accurately identifying whether a given file is malicious or benign. To achieve
this, we employed advanced techniques to examine the relationships between the file's features and
identify patterns indicative of malicious behavior.

This project was done as a final project as part of a Machine Learning course at Tel Aviv University.<br><br>We were given information about several features of executable files (.exe) and were asked to build a model that predicts the chance of a particular file to be malicious through static analysis of the files.<br>This project is a binary classification problem in which we classified files into two categories - is the file malicious (1) or not (0), based on the features in the data set. Some of the features we received are known and some are anonymous.<br>we received 60,000 observations that were classified as a malicious/non-malicious file. We analyze the given data, processed it and selected the best model to predict the patterns in the unseen test data.<br><br>We achieved a test AUC score of 0.9579 using "XGBoost classifier".<br>We recieved a score of 95 on this project.<br><br>The project is in Jupyter Notebook in Python and Markdown.<br><br>
